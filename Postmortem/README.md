# Postmortems

This directory contains detailed **incident postmortems** documenting technical issues, root causes, resolution steps, and prevention measures.

## Structure
Each postmortem is stored as a separate Markdown (`.md`) file and follows the same structure:
1. **Affected Service** — What system, application, or component was impacted.
2. **Incident Description** — A brief overview of the problem.
3. **Step-by-Step Resolution Process** — Exact actions taken, in chronological order.
4. **Lessons Learned** — Key takeaways from the incident.
5. **Prevention Plan** — Measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
6. **P.S.** — Additional notes (e.g., whether the postmortem is in an educational format).

## Naming Convention
Files are named using the date and a short description.

## Purpose
- Serve as a knowledge base for future troubleshooting.
- Provide training material for new system administrators.
- Maintain transparency and documentation of incident handling.

## Notes
Some postmortems are written in **educational format** with maximum detail for learning purposes.  
In production environments, postmortems may be shorter and more focused.
